The Loop Items Block component empowers you to iterate through the elements of a collection (array, list, etc.) of items.

**Item:** This property allows you to define a variable name to represent the current item within each iteration. By default, the variable item is used.

It utilises the same branch system as the [For Loop](/restapi/flow-builder/blocks/flow-control/for-loop#branches).

<Warning>
Deleting For Loop Items block will delete the entire flow connected to the block. 
</Warning>


### Accessing Value inside for loop

`val` - Returns an array containing the modified or filtered items based on the code executed within the <ins>Continues Until True</ins> branch. If the collection is not modified, the original collection is returned.

To access a particular object from a collection(array of objects) you can access with the syntax below 

```jsx
{{$block-name.val.object-key}}
```

```jsx Example
// sample collection
collectionsBlock = [
    {
        name: "Zeromagic",
        services : ["RestAPI","GraphQL"],
        founder : [
            {
                name : "Revanth",
                city : "Chennai",
                linkedin : "https://www.linkedin.com/in/revanth-nd-09/"
            },
            {
                name : "Rohith",
                city : "Chennai",
                linkedin : "https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohith-nd/"
            },
            {
                name : "Aravind",
                city : "Chennai",
                linkedin : "https://www.linkedin.com/in/aravind--swaminathan/"
            }
        ]
    }
]

// access "Zeromagic" from collections
{{$collectionsBlock.val.name}}

//access "Revanth" from collections
{{$collectionsBlock.val.founder[0].name}}

//access "RestAPI" from collections
{{$collectionsBlock.val.services[0]}}

```
