The Loop Items Block component empowers you to iterate through the elements of a collection (array, list, etc.) of items.

**Item:** This property allows you to define a variable name to represent the current item within each iteration. By default, the variable item is used.

It utilises the same branch system as the [For Loop](/restapi/flow-builder/blocks/flow-control/for-loop#branches).

<Warning>
Deleting For Loop Items block will delete the entire flow connected to the block.

### Accessing Value inside for loop

`val` - Returns an array containing the modified or filtered items based on the code executed within the <ins>Continues Until True</ins> branch. If the collection is not modified, the original collection is returned.

To access a particular object from a collection(array of objects) you can access with the syntax below 

```jsx
{{$block-name.val.object-key}}
```

```jsx Example
// sample collection
collections = [
    {
        name : "Rohith",
        age : 21
        city : "Chennai",
    },
    {
        name : "Revanth",
        age : 21
        city : "Banglore",
    },
    {
        name : "Aravind",
        age : 22
        city : "Mumbai",
    }
]

// access current object inside Forloop 
{{$forLoop.val.name}}

```
