This property allows you to define conditions (cases) for branching. Similar to the expression editor, the implementation may offer visual tools or text input for creating conditions. 

It utilises the same condition syntax as the [If Conditions](/restapi/flow-builder/blocks/flow-control/if-else#condition-editor).



<Warning>
Deleting Switch block will delete the entire flow connected to the block. 
</Warning>


###  Branch Selection:

**New Branch:** The new case whose condition evaluates to True is identified. The code block associated with that case (if present) is executed.

**Default Branch:** If no case condition matches the expression value, and a default branch is defined using the default keyword, the code associated with the default branch is executed

<Note>
If several conditions are met, only the first one in sequence will be executed.
</Note>

### Return Value

`val` - Returns a value that can be compared to the evaluated expression.
