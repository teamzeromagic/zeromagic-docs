**Flow Builder** is a powerful tool that empowers you to create automated processes and custom logic within your platform. It provides a visual interface for building workflows using a collection of pre-defined blocks. These blocks can be chained together to execute a sequence of actions, make decisions, interact with databases, and achieve complex functionalities.
