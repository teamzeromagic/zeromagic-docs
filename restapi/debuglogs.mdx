 The Debug Logs feature is designed to streamline the debugging process for REST APIs. It provides real-time insights into API requests and responses, helping you quickly identify and resolve issues.
Hereâ€™s how you can utilize this feature to optimize your API testing and debugging workflow:

Debug logs are retained for only 3 days.

## Using the Debug Logs Feature

1. Navigate to the RestAPI flow builder page. Access the `Logs` tab to start debugging your REST API.
2. Click the Debug button. A form will open where you can to specify the details for your API execution.
3. In the form, select the environment for the API execution, such as `dev` or `prod`.
4. Provide Request Data: 
    - **Query Params**: Enter the required parameters in JSON format.

    ```jsx Sample Data
    {
        "param1" : "value1",
        "param2" : "value2"
        ... // other params
    }
    ```
    
    - **Headers**:  Specify any necessary headers in JSON format. The API supports three types of authorization: `ALLOW-ALL`, `APP-KEY`, and `INTERNAL-BEARER-AUTHENTICATION`.

        a) For `ALLOW-ALL`, the authorization header is not required.

        b) For `APP-KEY` authentication, use APP-KEY as the header name.    
        
        c) For `INTERNAL-BEARER-AUTHENTICATION`, use INTERNAL-BEARER-AUTHENTICATION as the header name.

    <Note>
    Ensure the headers are named exactly as specified above.
    </Note>

        ```jsx Sample Data
        {
            "APP-KEY" : "<your-app-key>", // APP-KEY.
            "INTERNAL-BEARER-AUTHENTICATION" : "<your-bearer-token>", // INTERNAL-BEARER-AUTHENTICATION. 
            ... // other headers
        }
        ```


    - **Body Data**: Provide the body data for the request in JSON format.
    
    ```jsx Sample Data
    {
        "id" : "1",
        "name" : "goblin"
        ... // other data
    }
    ```
    
5. Click on the `Test API` button to execute the request.
6. After the request is executed, the logs are generated and can be viewed on the logs page. The logs contain crucial information for debugging:
    - **Data Size**: The size of the request and response data.
    - **Time Execution**: The time taken to execute the API request.
    - **Request Data**: The data sent with the request.
    - **Response Data**: The data received in response.


## Benefits 

- **Enhanced Debugging**: Gain comprehensive insights into the API requests and responses for effective problem-solving.
- **Environment Specification**: Choose the appropriate environment (dev, prod, etc.) for your test.
- **Comprehensive Input Control**: Specify exact parameters, headers, and body data in JSON format for precise testing.
- **Real-time Log Generation**: Instantaneously view detailed logs as the API request and response unfold.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor data size and execution time to identify performance bottlenecks.
