7. The workflow builder will initially display two default blocks: 
    
    API Endpoint Block: This block specifies the request method, the endpoint URL for your API, and whether it's a public route (accessible to everyone) or requires authentication.

    Response Block: This block defines the response value that your API will return and the corresponding HTTP response code.
