Zeromagic supports a range of database methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data. Available methods include readOne, readMany, createOne, createMany, updateOne, updateMany, deleteOne, and deleteMany, providing comprehensive support for data management tasks.

## Read Operations

a) `readOne`: Retrieve a single record by its `ID`.

```jsx readOne
{
  "container": "student",
  "filter":{
    "id": "1",
    }
}
```

b) `readMany`: Retrieve multiple records based on specific criteria using `filter property`.

```jsx readMany
{
    "container": "student",
    "filter":{
            "@sort": { "key": "name", "order": "asc" },
            "@fields" : ["id",{"name":"full_name"}, "status"],
            "@or" : [
                {
                    "name" : {
                        "@contains": "John Doe"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "status"  : {
                        "@in": ["active", "pending"]
                    }
                }
            ]
        } 
}
```

## Create Operations

a) `createOne`: Create a new record with the provided data in the `item property`.

```jsx createOne
{
  "container": "student",
   "item": {
     "id": "1",
     "age" : 30,
     "name": "Max",
     "subject" : ["science" , "biology"] 
    }
}
```

b) `createMany`: Create multiple records in a single operation using the `items property`.

```jsx createMany
{
  "container": "student",
   "items": [
    {
     "id": "1",
     "age" : 30,
     "name": "Max",
     "subject" : ["science" , "biology"] 
    },
    {
     "id": "2",
     "age" : 20,
     "name": "John",
     "subject" : ["maths"] 
    }
   ] 
}
```
## Update Operations

a) `updateOne`: Update an existing record based on its `ID` and new data provided in the `update property` within the query.

```jsx updateOne
{
  "container": "student",
  "id": "1", 
   "update": {
       "age": 25
   }
}
```
b) `updateMany`: Update multiple records based on `filter property` and new data provided in the `update property` within the query.

```jsx updateMany
{
  "container": "student",    
  "filter": {
     "subject" :  {
       "@in": ["maths" , "biology"] ,
     } 
    }, 
   "update": {
       "department": 'Science'
   }
}
```

## Delete Operations

a) `deleteOne`: Delete a single record by its `ID`.


```jsx deleteOne
{
  "container": "student",  
  "id": "1",
}
```

b) `deleteMany`: Delete multiple records based on specific criteria using `filter property`.


```jsx deleteMany
{
  "container": "student",   
  "filter":{
    "age" : {
