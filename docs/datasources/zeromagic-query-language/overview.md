# Overview of Zeromagic Query Language

Zeromgic empowers you to interact with your data using a familiar and intuitive `JSON-based query` language Inspired by `Cosmos DB`, this language provides a balance of ease of use for basic operations and expressiveness for complex scenarios. This streamlined approach simplifies data retrieval, manipulation, and management within your applications.

### Key Features

**JSON-Based Syntax:** Leverage the power and readability of `JSON` to construct your queries. This intuitive approach makes it easy to learn and use, even for developers unfamiliar with complex query languages.

**Filtering:** Utilize `filter` conditions to refine query results based on specified criteria. Zeromagic supports various filter operators, including `logical operators (and, or)`, `sorting options`, and `field selection` to customize query results according to your requirements.

**Sorting:** Arrange query results in `ascending or descending order` based on specified keys. Zeromagic allows for sorting records by key and order, facilitating organized and structured data presentation.

**Field Selection:** Specify the `fields`    to fetch from query results, optimizing data retrieval efficiency and reducing unnecessary data transfer. Zeromagic enables developers to select specific fields for retrieval, ensuring streamlined data processing and improved performance.

**Database Methods:** Zeromagic supports a range of database methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data. Available methods include `readOne`, `readMany`, `createOne`, `createMany`, `updateOne`, `updateMany`, `deleteOne`, and `deleteMany`, providing comprehensive support for data management tasks.
