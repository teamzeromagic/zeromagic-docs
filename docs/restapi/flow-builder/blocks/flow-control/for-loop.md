# For Loop

The Loop Block offers a structured approach for iterating through a sequence of numbers while incorporating conditional branching for flexible control flow.

The Loop Block allows you to iterate through a sequence of values, defined by a start value, an end value, and a step value. 

**Start:** Defines the initial value from which the loop iteration begins.

**Stop:** Specifies the final value that marks the end of the iteration sequence.

**Step Value:** Defines the increment (positive) or decrement (negative) used to move from one iteration to the next. Defaults to 1 (increment).

###  Branches:

**Continues Until True:** This branch, represented by the Unit Block, allows you to define a flow of operations that executes repeatedly as long as a specified condition evaluates to True. The Unit Block provides a dedicated space for building this internal flow.

**Ends If False:** This branch executes once when the condition within the Unit Block evaluates to False for the first time. This signifies the end of the loop iteration.


### Return Value

`val` - Represents the current loop variable `i` that holds the value during each iteration.

:::warning Deleting For Loop

Deleting For Loop block will delete the entire flow connected to the block.
