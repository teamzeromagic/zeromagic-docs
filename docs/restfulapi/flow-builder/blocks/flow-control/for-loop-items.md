# For Loop Items

The Loop Items Block component empowers you to iterate through the elements of a collection (array, list, etc.) of items.

**Item:** This property allows you to define a variable name to represent the current item within each iteration. By default, the variable item is used.


It utilises the same branch system as the [For Loop](for-loop#branches).

### Return Value

`items` - Returns an array containing the modified or filtered items based on the code executed within the _Continues Until True_ branch. If the collection is not modified, the original collection is returned.

:::warning Deleting For Loop Items
