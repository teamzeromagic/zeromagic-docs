# Authentication & User Identity

Zeromagic simplifies your project development with **authentication feature**, empowering you to manage user authentication seamlessly within your projects.With our `built-in authentication system`, you can create and manage user accounts effortlessly, eliminating the need for external authentication services.

Our platform simplifies user management by offering everything you need within the project console. **You can create and manage users from our console or using API**. According to your project's specific needs, you can choose from various authentication methods, including traditional email-password combinations or the added security of mobile-one-time passwords (OTPs). We even support Social authentication. You can maintain complete control over user information with a centralized user management feature. This user-friendly system allows you to configure your own templates for one-time codes, password resets, and email confirmations. Additionally you can update user details, reset passwords, and revoke access â€“ all from a single, convenient location within the project console.
