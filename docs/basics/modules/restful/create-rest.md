# Create RESTful API

- Within your Zeromagic project console, navigate to the `Modules` section. Locate and click on the specific module where you want to create your new API. This will take you to the Api Builder page.

- Within the builder page, access the `Restful` section in the sidebar to find the Rest API Workflow builder.

- Provide a suitable name, description and API Route for the API that aligns with its functionality.

- Choose the appropriate HTTP request method from the available options: GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE. Each method serves a specific purpose in RESTful APIs.

- Click on the `Create Rest API` button to generate the new API.

- The workflow builder will initially display two default blocks: 
    
    _API Endpoint Block:_ This block specifies the request method, the endpoint URL for your API, and whether it's a public route (accessible to everyone) or requires authentication.

    _Response Block:_ This block defines the response value that your API will return and the corresponding HTTP response code.
