title: 'Social Connections'
---

Social Connections are variety of built-in authentication methods that you can readily enable and configure. These methods offer secure and convenient ways for users to access your platform.

## Setup Client OAuth Redirect URI 
You must add your **client application url in OAuth Redirect Uri** under projects settings in dashboard. This is the uri where your success response will be appended as query params and you can parse this response in your client application.

<Note>
It is mandatory to add OAuth Redirect Uri for your social authentication method flow to work properly.
</Note>

**Step-1 :** Open your **Project Settings** in your dashboard.

**Step-2 :** Add your Client Application Url in **OAuth Redirect Uri** under your project settings. Here we are adding `http://localhost:3000/dashboard` as our client application url. You can add your client application url endpoint path where you want to receive your success response.

> Note : The access_token and other user details will be appended as query params in your client application url. You can parse this response in your client application.

## Create Social Connection
You can start creating connection within just few clicks. Follow the steps below steps to start creating a connection.

### Connection 1: Google Auth

1. Go to the Google Developers Console and [Create a new project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate).

2. Click on the project name and then select `APIs & Services` on your left sidebar tab. Click on `OAuth consent screen` and fill in the required details.

    <Note>
    IMPORTANT

    **Test users**: While your app is in development, you can add test users to your OAuth consent screen. **These users will be able to sign in to your app with their Google accounts** without needing to verify their identity. You can add test users by clicking on the `Add users` button in the OAuth consent screen configuration page.

    > You will need to verify and move your app to production before it can be used by anyone other than the test users you have added.
    </Note>

    SERVER CONFIGURATIONS

    Application URL - http://localhost:3000
        > We are using `http://localhost:3000` as the frontend application URL in **Authorized origins**. You can replace it with your actual ReactJS application URL when rolling out to production. Example: `https://your-reactjs-app.com`

    Oauth Callback or Authorized Redirect URI - https://auth.zeromagic.cloud/oauth/callback/
    </Note>

4. Copy the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` and we will use this to setup our authentication in the zeromagic platform.

5. Add the `Google` authentication connection under Methods. Click `Add Connection` to create a new connection with the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` you copied from the Google Developers Console.

6. Now, go to `Environments` sections and select the environment you created. Copy the `Auth Endpoint URL` from the environment details. This is your authentication endpoint URL where you will be sending the APi requests. Your Auth endpoint URL looks similar to this:

    The oauth api endpath is **/oauth** and environment url **http://auth.zeromagic.cloud/auth/86165f63f34e4be89809c2948c424a99/development/**. So, the final URL will be 

    ```curl OAuth Endpoint
    http://auth.zeromagic.cloud/auth/86165f63f34e4be89809c2948c424a99/development/oauth  
    ```
