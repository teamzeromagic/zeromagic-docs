Environments provide a structured approach to managing deployments for your projects. Each environment acts as a distinct stage in your development lifecycle, allowing you to isolate, test, and ultimately deploy your user's API to production.

## Create Environment
 
- To create a new environment, head to the **Environments** section in the **project console**.

- Choose a _"name"_ that clearly identifies the purpose of the environment. 
- Select the specific `database` you want to connect to from the available dropdown menu. This database will be linked to this environment.
- By clicking on `Create Environment` will set up your new environment, ready for deployment process.
