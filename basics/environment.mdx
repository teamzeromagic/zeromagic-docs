Environments provide a structured approach to managing deployments for your projects. Each environment acts as a distinct stage in your development lifecycle, allowing you to isolate, test, and ultimately deploy your user's API to production.

{/* 
Zeromagic offers distinct environments for:

1. <ins>**REST API**</ins>: This environment is dedicated to supporting applications that interact using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
2. <ins>**GraphQL**</ins>: This separate environment is specifically designed for applications that utilize the GraphQL query language.
*/}

<Note>
Zeromagic maintains RestAPI and GraphQL environments independently to ensure optimal performance and stability for each interaction method.
</Note>
 
## Create Environment
 
- To create a new environment, head to the **Environments** section in the **project console**.
