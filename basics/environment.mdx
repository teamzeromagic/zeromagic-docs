Environments provide a structured approach to managing deployments for your projects. Each environment acts as a distinct stage in your development lifecycle, allowing you to isolate, test, and ultimately deploy your user's API to production.

{/* 
Zeromagic offers distinct environments for:

1. <ins>**REST API**</ins>: This environment is dedicated to supporting applications that interact using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
2. <ins>**GraphQL**</ins>: This separate environment is specifically designed for applications that utilize the GraphQL query language.
*/}

<Note>
    An environment is required to deploy and execute your APIs. You can create multiple environments for a single project, where each environment can be executed independently with different performance associated with the tier plan.
</Note>
 
## Create Environment
 
1. To create a new environment, head to the **Environments** section in the **project console**.

 While creating an environment, you can choose the database you want to map. Your REST API operations will be performed only in this mapped database. Other database are not affected.
</Tip>

## Manage Environment
