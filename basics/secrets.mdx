## Available Secret Types

1. **Password :** Passwords are used for user authentication purposes. They grant access to protected systems, databases, or applications.
2. **Token :** Tokens are short-lived pieces of data used for authentication or authorization. They often act as temporary credentials for accessing resources.
3. **API Key :** API keys are unique identifiers used to authenticate applications or users when interacting with APIs.
4. **Basic Auth :** Basic authentication is a simple authorization scheme that transmits credentials (username and password) directly within the request header.
