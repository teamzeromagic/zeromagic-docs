Zeromagic empowers you to create well-organized and scalable APIs using a **modular approach**. This means you can break down your project functionalities into smaller, independent units called modules. Each module can be independently developed, tested, and deployed, promoting efficient API development and maintenance.

Within your newly created module, you can define specific API routes **(RESTful or GraphQL)** that expose functionalities related to the module's purpose.
