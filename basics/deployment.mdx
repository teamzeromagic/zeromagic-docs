Our platform offers a streamlined deployment feature that allows you to easily push your APIs to the desired environment. With just one click, you can manage your deployments efficiently and access your APIs through a simple URL format.

## Deployment Process

Once you have created and tested your API, you are ready to deploy it.

- For [**REST API**](/restapi/overview): Simply click the `Deploy` button to push your API to the deployment environments.
- For [**GraphQL**](/graphql/overview): Your API is automatically deployed to the environments after you edit the `Schema`.

## Access Your API

Choose the environment where you want to access your API (e.g., development, staging, production).

Your deployed API can be accessed using the following URL format: 

```jsx
{base_url}/{app_id}/{env_name}/{api_name}
```

- **base_url**:  The base URL provided by your platform. It remains constant across deployments.
- **app_id**: The `APP ID` of your particular project.
- **env_name**: The name of the environment (e.g., dev, staging, prod).
- **api_name**: The name you assigned to your API during the building process.

### Example

If your base URL is `http://localhost:8000/app/` and your App ID is `a561a95719d24f46b0640f3b342f891e`, you want to deploy to the `staging` environment, and your API name is `user-management`, your API will be accessible at:

```jsx
http://localhost:8000/app/a561a95719d24f46b0640f3b342f891e/staging/user-management
```

<Note>
You can copy the <ins>API Endpoint</ins> from the desired RestAPI/QraphQL builder page.
