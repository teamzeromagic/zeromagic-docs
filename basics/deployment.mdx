Our platform offers a streamlined deployment feature that allows you to easily push your APIs to the desired environment. With just one click, you can manage your deployments efficiently and access your APIs through a simple URL format.

## Deployment Process

Once you have created and tested your API, you are ready to deploy it.

- For [**REST API**](/restapi/overview): Simply click the `Deploy` button to push your API to the deployment environments.
- For [**GraphQL**](/graphql/overview): Your API is automatically deployed to the environments after you edit the `Schema`.

## Access Your API

Choose the environment where you want to access your API (e.g., development, staging, production). For each environment, three URLs are available:
- **REST AUTH**:  This URL handles all the authentication requests for the in-built authentication system.
- **REST APP**: This URL is used to access the APIs you have built.
- **GRAPHQL**: This URL is used to access the GraphQL APIs you have built.

### Example Format

```jsx REST AUTH
{base_url}/auth/{app_id}/{env_name}/{api_endpoint_path}
```

```jsx REST APP
{base_url}/api/{app_id}/{env_name}/{api_endpoint_path}
```

```jsx GRAPHQL
{base_url}/{app_id}/{env_name}/{api_endpoint_path}/graphql
```

- **base_url**:  The base URL provided by your platform. It remains constant across deployments.
- **app_id**: The `APP ID` of your particular project.
- **env_name**: The name of the environment (e.g., dev, staging, prod).
- **api_name**: The name you assigned to your API during the building process.


If your App ID is `a561a95719d24f46b0640f3b342f891e`, you want to deploy to the `staging` environment then, your API will be accessible at:

```jsx REST AUTH
https://authn.zeromagic.cloud/auth/a561a95719d24f46b0640f3b342f891e/staging/email-password-login
```

```jsx REST APP
https://api.zeromagic.cloud/api/a561a95719d24f46b0640f3b342f891e/staging/create-todo/
```

```jsx GRAPHQL
https://api.zeromagic.cloud/a561a95719d24f46b0640f3b342f891e/staging/todo/graphql
```

<Note>
You can copy the API Endpoint from the desired RestAPI/QraphQL builder page.
