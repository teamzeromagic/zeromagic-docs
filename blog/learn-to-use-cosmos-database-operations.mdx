Do you need a highly scalable and globally distributed NoSQL database for your modern application? Look no further than Azure Cosmos DB!

In this blog post, we will dive into the various operations you can perform on Azure Cosmos DB using the Zeromagic platform. Whether you need to create, read, update, or delete data, Zeromagic provides a set of predefined actions to help you manage your database efficiently. These operations include CreateOne, CreateMany, ReadOne, ReadMany, DeleteOne, DeleteMany, UpdateOne, UpdateMany, and Custom Filter queries. Let's explore each operation in detail to understand how you can use them to manage your Cosmos DB effectively.

</Tip>

Login to [Zeromagic Platform](https://console.zeromagic.cloud/) and go to you `Project Console`. Now navigate to `Modules` in the sidebar of the console. Click on the necessary Module and navigate to the Flow Builder Page.

## 1. CreateOne

The `CreateOne` operation allows you to insert a single document into your Cosmos DB container. This is useful when you need to add individual records to your database.

1. Add a CreateOne block to your workflow. Set the `record to add` field to `{{$request.body}}` so as to specify the data that will be used to create the new record.
2. In the `Http Response` block , set the `Response Variable` field to expression as `{{$block-name.val}}`.
 

```bash API URL
<base_url>/student/
``` 
![CreateOne](/assets/blogs/learn-to-use-cosmos-database-operations/createOne.png)

### Sample Data

```json Request Body Data
{
    "id": "1",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "courses" : ["maths", "science", "english"],
    "dept" : "CSE"
}
```

```json Response Data
{
  "data": {
    "id": "1",
    "_ts": 1726552985,
    "_rid": "5bQ3ANPWhcUHAAAAAAAAAA==",
    "dept": "CSE",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "_etag": "\"0000650d-0000-0300-0000-66e91b990000\"",
    "_self": "dbs/5bQ3AA==/colls/5bQ3ANPWhcU=/docs/5bQ3ANPWhcUHAAAAAAAAAA==/",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "_module": "rest_student",
    "courses": [
      "maths",
      "science",
      "english"
    ],
    "_attachments": "attachments/"
  }
}
```

## 2. CreateMany

The `CreateMany` operation enables you to insert multiple documents at once. This is ideal for batch operations where you need to add several records simultaneously.

1. Add a CreateMany block to your workflow. Set the `Create Value` field to `{{$request.body.<key>}}` so as to specify the data that will be used to create the new record.
2. In the `Http Response` block , set the `Response Variable` field to expression as `{{$block-name.val}}`.
 
 ```bash API URL
<base_url>/student/bulk/
``` 

![CreateMany](/assets/blogs/learn-to-use-cosmos-database-operations/createMany.png)

### Sample Data

```json Request Body Data
 {
  "students": [
  {
    "id": "2",
    "name": "Jim Beam",
    "email": "jim.beam@example.com",
    "courses" : ["physics", "english"],
    "dept" : "ECE"
},
{
    "id": "3",
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane.doe@example.com",
    "courses" : ["maths", "science"],
    "dept" : "CSE"
} 
]
 }
```

```json Response Data

      "_self": "dbs/5bQ3AA==/colls/5bQ3ANPWhcU=/docs/5bQ3ANPWhcUIAAAAAAAAAA==/",
      "email": "jim.beam@example.com",
      "_module": "rest_student",
      "courses": [
        "physics",
        "english"
      ],
      "_attachments": "attachments/"
    },
    {
      "id": "3",
      "_ts": 1726553235,

      "courses": [
        "maths",
        "science"
      ],
      "_attachments": "attachments/"
    }
  ]
}
```
 

## 3. ReadOne

The `ReadOne` operation allows you to retrieve a single document based on its unique identifier. This is useful when you need to fetch specific records.

1. Add a ReadOne block to your workflow. Set the `Record Id` field to `{{$request.body.id}}` so as to specify the data that will be used to create the new record.
2. In the `Http Response` block , set the `Response Variable` field to expression as `{{$block-name.val}}`.

 ```bash API URL
<base_url>/student/{id}/
``` 

![readOne](/assets/blogs/learn-to-use-cosmos-database-operations/readOne.png)

### Sample Data

```json Request Data
curl -X GET https://api.zeromagic.cloud/api/b819ea802f674352beec615db8297262/dev/operations/student/1/ \
-H "APP-KEY: YOUR_APP_KEY"
```

```json Response Data
{
  "data": {
    "id": "1",
    "_ts": 1726552985,
    "_rid": "5bQ3ANPWhcUHAAAAAAAAAA==",
    "dept": "CSE",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "_etag": "\"0000650d-0000-0300-0000-66e91b990000\"",
    "_self": "dbs/5bQ3AA==/colls/5bQ3ANPWhcU=/docs/5bQ3ANPWhcUHAAAAAAAAAA==/",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "_module": "rest_student",
    "courses": [
      "maths",
      "science",
      "english"
    ],
    "_attachments": "attachments/"
  }
}
```
 
## 4. ReadMany

The `ReadMany` operation lets you fetch multiple documents that match a given criteria. This is beneficial for retrieving a set of records based on certain conditions.

```bash API URL
<base_url>/students/
``` 

1. Add a ReadMany block to your workflow.  Set the `Sort Key` field to **name**, which corresponds to the data key in the schema, and choose either `asc` or `desc` for the `Sort Order`, depending on how you want the data to be sorted.

2. In the `Http Response` block , set the `Response Variable` field to expression as `{{$block-name.val}}`.
