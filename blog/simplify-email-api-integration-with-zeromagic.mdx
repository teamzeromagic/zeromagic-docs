Sending emails is a core part of many business applications, whether for communication, marketing, or notifications. Traditionally, setting up an email API requires a lot of time and coding effort—integrating SMTP, handling authentication, and writing custom code to format the content and handle requests.

With Zeromagic, you can now create an API for sending emails in a matter of minutes using the intuitive Flow Builder. No more complex configurations or extensive code—just a few simple steps, and you're ready to go.

## How It Works:

Zeromagic simplifies the process to just three essential fields:

- **Recipient Email:** The email address of the person you want to send the message to.
- **Subject:** The subject line of the email.
- **Mail Body:** The body text of your message.
Once you post this data to your custom API built with Zeromagic, the platform handles the rest—seamlessly sending out the email while you focus on other tasks.

## Steps to Create the API:

1. Log in to your Zeromagic console and create a new API flow such as **Send Email API**.
2. Drag and drop the `Send Email` action into your flow.
3. Add input fields for recipient email, subject, and content

4. Click on `Deploy` button for instant API deployment 
5. Use Zeromagic's built-in testing tool to ensure your API is functioning as expected.

And that’s it! Your email API is live and ready to handle requests.

## Test Your Email API

Enter the desired recipient email, subject, and message content. Click "Test": Trigger the API call to simulate sending the email. Examine the response to verify successful email delivery and any potential errors.
