<Accordion title="How do I avoid URL conflicts when using '/student/{id}/' and '/student/bulk/' in my API?">
The conflict arises because the `/student/{id}/` endpoint uses a dynamic path parameter `:id`, which can potentially match the `/bulk` segment in the `/student/bulk/` endpoint. To avoid this conflict, you can modify the URL paths to be more distinct:

- `/student/{id}/` remains unchanged.
- `/students/bulk/` is a more specific path for bulk update operations.

By using the plural form students in the bulk update path, you clearly differentiate it from the single-item update path.

<Accordion title="Can 'loop.val' be accessed outside the loop?">
The `forloop.val` variable is specific to the loop block and cannot be directly accessed outside of it. Attempting to access forloop.val outside the loop will result in an error indicating that the `variable is not in memory`.

<Accordion title="Preventing Comparison Errors Due to Incorrect Data Types in If Else Condition Editor">
When using comparison operators `(e.g., >, <, >=, <=)`, verify that the field data types are compatible. 
For example, If the `id` field is of type `string`, using `id > 10` would result in an error. You cannot directly compare a string value with a numeric value using numerical comparison operators.
