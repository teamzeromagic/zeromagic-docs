Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed NoSQL, relational, and vector database. It offers single-digit millisecond response times, automatic and instant scalability, along with guaranteed speed at any scale. 
Azure Cosmos DB simplifies and expedites your application development by being the single database for your operational data needs, from geo-replicated distributed caching to backup to vector indexing and search. It provides the data infrastructure for modern applications like AI agent, digital commerce, Internet of Things, and booking management. It can accommodate all your operational data models, including relational, document, vector, key-value, graph, and table.
As a fully managed service, Azure Cosmos DB takes database administration off your hands with automatic management, updates, and patching. It also handles capacity management with cost-effective serverless and automatic scaling options that respond to application needs to match capacity with demand.

## APIs in Azure Cosmos DB
Azure Cosmos DB offers multiple database APIs, which include NoSQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Cassandra, Gremlin, and Table. By using these APIs, you can model real world data using documents, key-value, graph, and column-family data models. These APIs allow your applications to treat Azure Cosmos DB as if it were various other databases technologies, without the overhead of management, and scaling approaches
- Azure Cosmos DB API for NoSQL
- Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB
- Azure Cosmos DB API for Cassandra
- Azure Cosmos DB API for Gremlin
- Azure Cosmos DB API for Table

<Note>
  Currently, Zeromagic supports the Azure Cosmos DB API for NoSQL only.
