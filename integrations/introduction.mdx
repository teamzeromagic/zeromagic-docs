Zeromagic empowers you to extend the capabilities of your projects by connecting to various external services and APIs through integrations. These integrations allow you to leverage the functionalities of third-party platforms like chatGPT, Twilio, and many others, directly within your Zeromagic projects.

<Note>
Configure or update your integrations directly within the **Integrations** section of the project console.
