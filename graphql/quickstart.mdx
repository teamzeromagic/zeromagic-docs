- Within your Zeromagic project console, navigate to the `GraphQL` section. Click on the `Create GraphQL` button to create a GraphQL API instance for your application. This action will prompt a form to appear, allowing you to define the API details.

- Provide a suitable name and API Route for the API that aligns with its functionality. 

<Note>

The URL for your GraphQL API will automatically include `graphql/` at the end. You don't need to specify this part in the configuration.

# GraphiQL

These connectors act as bridges between your GraphQL endpoint and your actual data sources (databases, APIs, etc.).
